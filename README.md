The MSE for the Linear Regression was: 24.29 


The Neural Network Example generated an MSE of : 25.10 


The modified Example generated a MSE when more layers added and neurons were changed from 13-30: 18.01

My Neural Network had 5 layers with 64 neurons - I ran it with 20 loops/epoch 
My MSE was: 9.59


The 128 neurons and 5 hidden layers generated a MSE of: 12.40
